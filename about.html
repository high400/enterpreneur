          </h3>
          <p>
            There are 4 reasons why you work, that i have concluded after years
            of witnessing the same Loops, over and over again, especially in my
            own country. So i'll just tell you what those are, without stalling
            any further.<br />
            <h3>1.Money</h3><br />
            <p>This is so obvious. Who wouldn't? i do. Everybody works for money,
            including rich people. I don't even have to be a genius to tell you
            that. Of course, there will be a bunch of people who always act all
            high and mighty like "oh, the rich do not work for Money, they work
            for Assets", and you will just laugh it off. I know it sounds
            obvious to you, but if the rich don't work for money, then how the
            hell are they gonna be in charge of their own money? You can't know
            how to manage and control your money, if you don't work for it. The
            main Core here is "what is controlling what". If you let your money
            control you, then you are screwed.</p><br />
            <h3>2.Credit</h3><br />
            <p>Does it sound ambiguous to you? I sure hope it does, because this is
            the second thing we work for. You may think i am talking about
            something so superior, but actually, it is the thing right in front
            of you. Let me just ask you this, will you work with someone who
            just literally cheated you to buy a Fake Kitchen Knife or a Rotten
            Meat? Oh wait, that was a dumb question. And yet, that is the
            mistake we always make, even though it is as clear as day. We keep
            working with people who are not trustworthy, and deceitful. If we
            don't trust each other, then technically, we're at war, because that
            is what people did in War Time, they LIE to each other. If you want
            to be at War, just read Art of War and then go back to Chinese Civil
            War or Sengoku period in Japan. This is what happens when people
            have NO CREDIT. They will just go to War. This is the Cycle that i
            have read in Histories and have had chances to see that in reality
            way too many times. Even i don't want to believe it is true.</p><br />
            <h3>3.Reward</h3><br />
            <p>Everyone wants this, and it varies. Rewards can be anything, depends
            on what you want. For example, i just want a PS4 and my 3 favorite
            games include: Sekiro, God of War IV, and Mortal Kombat 11. And for
            you guys, i have no ideas, but i'll leave this for you to decide.</p><br />
            <h3>4.Nation</h3><br />
            <p>This one is the combination of the other three. You want to work for
            a Nation, you need to have all of them combine. As to why you want
            to do this....i am sure people have their reasons. I am no God, so i
            don't know. But i can be certain of one thing, is that when your
            society has come to a point that Decadence and Corruption has become
            the 'Daily Routines', then you will want to do something to make
            your country great again. This is the case with Legends such as
            Mr.Chiang Kai Shek, and right now, Mr.Donald Trump.<br />
            Now this is something so BIG. Work for a Nation? My god, this is so
            Huge. If you think so, then...you're right, it is. It requires you
            to look at the BIG PICTURES, stop thinking just about yourselves,
            and put everything on a LARGE SCALE. This is no joke. You will have
            to think about things like what Legacy you're gonna leave behind,
            how you are gonna make an example for people to look at you and you
            will have accept even their Lies, their Despise, so on and so
            forth.<br />
            You will have to consider every possibility that can happen,
            otherwise, people will kick you in the balls so hard that the next
            day, you will probably become a eunuch, just saying. Which one you
            choose, is up to you. I'm just listing them here. However, whatever
            you choose, you have to be responsible for your choice. Once you
            chose one option, you have to go with it till the very end. You can
            only have One Option, don't distract yourself with multiple options.
            Nobody has multiple options, that is A Lie. Burn the Boats, DO IT.</p>

            They thought Fighters only know how to fight, but the truth of the
            matter is, that is only half right. They also think that IT guys
            know nothing about society, or that they are too stupid. That is,
            again, only half right.
