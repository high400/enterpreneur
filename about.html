          <p>
            Men are the Symbol of Order, whereas Women are the Symbol of Chaos.
            Therefore, don't ever let any women be In Charge of your life,
            especially in a family. The Role of a Father is way more important
            than a mother. Yes, Mother can Give Birth.....but only a Father can
            Turn a Boy Into a Man. The Mother will do quite the opposite. They
            will turn a boy into a little girl(Error version), then slowly turn
            them into beta bitches. Do not let that happen. If you, a Father let
            that happen, you better get choked on your own dick.

            They thought Fighters only know how to fight, but the truth of the
            matter is, that is only half right. They also think that IT guys
            know nothing about society, or that they are too stupid. That is,
            again, only half right.
