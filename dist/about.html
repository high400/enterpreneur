          <p>
            1.Men are the Symbol of Order, whereas Women are the Symbol of
            Chaos. Therefore, don't ever let any women be In Charge of your
            life, especially in a family. The Role of a Father is way more
            important than a mother. Only a Father can turn a Boy into a Man,
            and shows his Daughter how to choose her future husband. If not, she
            is just gonna continue the cycle of Single Moms. I am no Fan of
            Single Moms.<br />
            2.Don't get me wrong, i don't hate Women. Many of you think so just
            because of reading this, but no i don't. And also, i don't love them
            either.....no no no. I have no horror feelings towards them, i have
            just given up on the concept of marriage. I have seen that scenario
            happen way too many times to tell. I see no reasons to believe in
            marriage anymore. The Scenario here is that, Men are always the
            person who have to pay for child support, blah blah blah...you get
            the drill. Not to mention the women are always the ones who file the
            divorce. I mean, what the hell? This is the case with Women all the
            time. Good or Bad Women, that is not the case. The case here is
            that, Women are not Rational enough to be Adult, and not Wise to
            make any important decisions. They are terrible Decision makers.
            That explains why kids are raised in single mothers household always
            turned out to be either stupid(a.k.a Weak, i'll explain later) or
            problematic with Society.<br />
            3.Courage and Wisdom go in pairs, just like Cowardice and Idiocy.<br />
            4.I'm no God, just a Normal Guy. I just happen to express myself
            honestly, like the way Bruce Lee said before.

            They thought Fighters only know how to fight, but the truth of the
            matter is, that is only half right. They also think that IT guys
            know nothing about society, or that they are too stupid. That is,
            again, only half right.
