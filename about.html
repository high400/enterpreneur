            There are 4 reasons why you work, that i have concluded after years
            of witnessing the same Loops, over and over again, especially in my
            own country. Those loops look like a big joke, that you cannot run
            away from. And they are:<br />
          </p>

          <h3>1.Money</h3>
          <br />

          <h3>2.Credit</h3>
          <br />

          <h3>3.Reward</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>4.Nation</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Last but not least, the main reason why you work, is to "Make Fear
            your Best Friend".
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h4>
            What do i mean by this? I mean, if you have no Fear of anything, you
            will not get your ass up and do anything. You don't believe me?
            People like that are all over the place, you just need to open your
            eyes and look at them, you will see.<br />
            Now don't get me wrong, making Fear your Best Friend does not mean
            that you Let your "Best Friend" control you, no no no no no.<br />
            Making Fear your Best Friend, that means you have to be the one who
            is in Charge of the Situation. Your "Best Friend"'s job here is to
            remind you of your work, of what you need to get done. It has a
            "Term" for that, actually, it's called "Deadline" or "You're fired"
            or "You're unemployed", etc...<br />
            If you let your Fear take over, you will become actually unemployed,
            or get fired for being a lazy ass, dumb S.O.B. Also, if you have No
            Fear, you will not do anything and just be like "Nah, i'm cool". The
            Control lies somewhere in between, and that's where you gotta be.<br />
            If you can control yourself, then you will be able to control the
            other things.

            They thought Fighters only know how to fight, but the truth of the
            matter is, that is only half right. They also think that IT guys
            know nothing about society, or that they are too stupid. That is,
            again, only half right.
